## Features

* **Automated Notifications**: The system provides automated reminders for various vehicle maintenance tasks, such as oil changes, tire rotations, and battery checks.
* **Real-time Alerts**: Users receive real-time notifications for critical service needs.
* **Data-driven Insights**: The system facilitates data-driven decision-making through features like:
    * **Segmentation**: Grouping vehicles based on maintenance schedules or other criteria.
    * **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the maintenance needs and histories of different vehicles.
    * **Predictive Modeling**: Using historical data to predict future maintenance requirements.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories and files:

* `battery/`: Handles logic related to battery service and notifications.
* `engine/`: Contains code for engine maintenance reminders.
* `test/`: Holds unit tests and integration tests for the project.
* `tire/`: Manages all functionality related to tire service and notifications.
* `car.py`: Defines the `Car` class, likely handling vehicle attributes and state.
* `car_factory.py`: Contains a factory for creating car objects, promoting a scalable and modular design.
* `serviceable.py`: Likely an interface or base class that defines the core logic for any serviceable component.
* `utils.py`: A collection of utility functions used throughout the project.
